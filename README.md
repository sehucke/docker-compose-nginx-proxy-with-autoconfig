# dockerized-nginx-proxy-with-autoconfig
Using docker-compose for running a Nginx reverse proxy with a Let's Encrypt companion and docker-gen for automatic config generation.

This work is mostly based on explanations from https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy, i.e. it is merely a specific instantiation of many config options listed there. Thus it makes use of https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion and https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen/
